            <p class="hidden">Friends since their University of San Francisco days, Gerald Baldwin, a former English teacher, Gordon Bowker, a writer, 
            and Zev Siegl, a history teacher, were three 20-somethings who were passionate about the arts, fine food, good wine and, 
            of course, great coffee. They started Starbucks because they wanted Seattle to have access to the delicious dark-roasted
            coffee that they loved but had to go out of town to find.</p>
